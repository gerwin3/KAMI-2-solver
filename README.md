# KAMI 2 Solver

Algorithm to solve KAMI 2 (the app) puzzles.

## Dependencies

* C5 Library

## Usage
It should be able to read an input.png - a screenshot (I used iPhone 7) and parse the picture itself.
Be sure to adjust the target: Second parameter in function Algorithm.Bfs (Program.cs:20).
It will then output an output.bmp image which shows the solution, it will also output the solution to the console.
Disclaimer: Will contain bugs.
